        <p>As per the assignment I have completed 3 personal profile tests.</p>
        <p>Myers-Briggs test - https://www.myersbriggs.org,/p>
        <p>Learning style test – https://educationplanner.org</p>
        <p>Creativity test – https://testmycreativity.org</p>
        <p>My results from the Myers-Briggs test are Extraversion, Intuition, Thinking and Judging.</p>
        <p>My results from the learning style test are Auditory 55%, Visual 35% and Tactile 10%. </p>
        <p>My results from creativity test mostly say that I am bold and curious.</p>
        <p>I think the results are accurate as I am an organised person in and out of work, and I am always looking to improve.  I prefer to learn more verbally but also visually. I think my results may influence my behaviour in a team because I am a thinker and I will make my oppinions and ideas heard. When forming a team I think I would be good being paired up with similar personalities and both opposite to get a different range of ideas and approaches.
